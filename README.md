# Keystone Tracker

This is my first World of Warcraft Addon. 

The purpose of this addon will be to track all Mythic+ Keystones on any character on any realm. Also use this to learn more about Addon-programming in WoW


# My Feature Wishlist:

1. List all Keystones from any Char in a Table
2. Create a Config panel for the addon to allow users to set some preferences
3. Add information about current and upcoming M+ Affixes
4. Maybe include links to keystone guru/raider.io/mdt
5. Keep Track of M+ Highscore like fastest run, highest run, etc.
